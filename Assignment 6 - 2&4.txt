The less than operator is used in order to ensure the largest item as at the top of the queue. On insertion, all items that
are less than the current "back" value are pushed onto the back of the queue. This causes the larger values to be towards towards
the "front" of the queue with the very largest at the top. If the greater than operator was used, this would cause the minimum 
value to be at the queue's top and the maximum to be at the back (which would lead to a larger runtime if removing the largest 
value).
